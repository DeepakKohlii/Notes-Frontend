# Notes Application

This is a Notes Application created using **React** and **Material UI**. It is designed to help users manage their notes in a simple and efficient manner. Users can register and login to their account to access their personal notes.

The application provides several features to enhance the user experience. Users can add new notes with a title and description. They can also pin important notes to the top for easy access. If a note is no longer needed in the main view but the user doesn't want to delete it, they can archive it. When a note is no longer needed at all, users have the option to delete it permanently.

The application is easy to install and use, and it runs locally on your machine. Follow the instructions below to get started.
